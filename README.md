This is the repository for my personal website, created using [Angular](https://angular.io/) version 15.

## Running the Development Server
After cloning the project, `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies with npm.

Run `ng serve` to run the dev server, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser to view the site.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.
